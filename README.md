Legacy portfolio site built 2015. Updated 2020.

Temporary portfolio till replacement React app is built.

## Known legacy code and best practices issues:

- jQuery for animations and scrolling
- Blob storage for images
- Using string concatenation vs template literals(string interpolation)
- CSS should use rems instead of pxs
- Is requestAnimationFrame even needed anymore for modern browsers?
